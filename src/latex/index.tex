The problem entails solving the partial differential equation concerning the contraction of the left ventricle when a force acts on the internal surface of the ventricle, known as the Endocardium. We model the acting forces as pressure without considering how the force is generated. Our modeling strategy follows a bottom-\/up approach\+: initially, we employ a simplified geometry and basic mathematical model, making assumptions about material properties. Subsequently, we refine the model by incorporating a more intricate formulation that accounts for the material properties. This testing methodology is inspired by the approach outlined \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26807042/}{\texttt{ here}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Constructive law\+: Guccione}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
This section covers the finite element solver for materials that follow the \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8550635/}{\texttt{ Guccioneâ€™s Law}}.

An abstract base solver class {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classBaseSolverGuccione}{Base\+Solver\+Guccione}}} has been introduced as a base line starting point for each mesh test that we have run. This is a complete solver except for the boundaries initialization which must occur in any derived class as every problem is different.

The base class takes in account a pressure component that pushes on {\itshape {\bfseries{x}}} boundaries, referred as Newmann boundaries. If your problem does not follow this pattern, please {\itshape {\bfseries{override}}} all the needed implementations (this might the {\ttfamily assemble} method).

Dirichlet boundaries condition values are assigned in the derived class.

{\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classBaseSolverGuccione}{Base\+Solver\+Guccione}}}\textquotesingle{}s extension is a trivial task in order to create custom tests (e.\+g. {\ttfamily Slab\+Cubic\+Guccione}).\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Constructive law\+: New Hook}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
